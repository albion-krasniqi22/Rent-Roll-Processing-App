# Rent-Roll-Processing-App


Streamlit Apps: end-to-end.py and rent-roll-processor-full-app.py
This repository contains two Streamlit applications designed to achieve the same purpose—processing data—using slightly different methodologies (one was trained on csv and the other json inputs). You can choose to use either app.

Before running either app, ensure the following:

**Python Environment:**
- Install Python 3.8 or higher.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
  
**Secrets Configuration:**
- Create a secrets.toml file in the project root directory. This file is essential for app functionality. Example format:
toml
- your_service_key = "your_key_here"


**Running the Applications**
You can run either app based on your preference. The steps are the same:

Choose an App:

- To run the end-to-end app, execute: streamlit run end-to-end.py
- To run the rent roll processing app, execute: streamlit run rentroll_processing_app.py


**Interact with the App:**
- After running the command, a browser window will open automatically.
